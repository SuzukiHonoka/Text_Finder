A tool helps you find the files which contains the text you wanted to find.

## Usage

Usage of Text_Finder.exe:

  -l int
        overview limit for single match (default 3)
  -p string
        path to scan as root (default ".")
  -r    reserve mode
  -t string
        file type to match (default "go")
